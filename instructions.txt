Note: If you build a new .pem file you need to create new ca.crt, server.key, server.crt and client.crt files

4096 KEY SETUP
  •	cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
  •	sudo nano vars
    o	find export KEY_SIZE=2048 line
      	change to =4096 for paranoid
      	change to =1024 for testing
  •	ctrl-x, y, enter

CREATE NEW FILES
  •	sudo –s
  •	cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
  •	. ./vars
  •	./build-dh
    o	wait 5 hours if doing within RPi3, faster in VM
    o	when done it will be located in /etc/openvpn
  •	./clean-all
    o	keys folder must be cleared to generate new files, make a backup of all 2046bit files
  •	./build-ca
  •	./build-key-server server
  •	./build-key client1

•	copy all files required for the server from /keys into /openvpn
    o	ca.crt
    o	server.key
    o	server.crt
    o	server.conf
      	use old one
    o	static.key
      	use old one for both server and client
      	if new static.key file is generated, make sure both server and client has the file
      	key is always 2046bit

•	copy all files required for the clients from /keys into ~/client
    o	ca.crt
    o	client1.crt
    o	client1.key
    o	client1.ovpn
      	use the old .ovpn file without the ca, crt and key data
  •	cat and echo the .crt files and .key files into .ovpn
  •	transfer to clients
    o	client1.ovpn
    o	static.key

Note: must have the following files to create new client files, otherwise, new server CAs and key files will need to be generated:
  •	ca.crt
  •	dh dh4096.pem
  •	server.crt
  •	server.key
  •	server.conf
  •	static.key
